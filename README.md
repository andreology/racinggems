Solution to solve Racing Gems problem provided in prompt 



You are playing a racing game. Your character starts at the x axis line (y = 0)
and proceeds up the racetrack, which has a boundary at the line x = 0 and
x = w. The finish is at y = h, and the game ends when you reach that line.
You proceed at a fixed vertical velocity v, but you can control your horizontal
velocity to be any value between -v/r and v/r, and change it at any time.
There are a set of gems at specific points on the race track. Your job is to
maximize the total value of the gems that you collect. Each gems has a value
associated with it
